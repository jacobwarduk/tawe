Notes
=====
When I tried to open the `DesignAssets.psd` file, it would only open as a flat image, rather than as layers. As such:

 - I didn't have access to the correct font, so I have improvised with the closest match I could find.
 - I couldn't make accurate measurements between elements, so have done it 'by eye'.
