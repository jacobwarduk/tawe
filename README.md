Notes
-----
I have completed both the 'Required' and 'Optional' portions of the challenge.

When I tried to open the `DesignAssets.psd` file, it would only open as a flat image, rather than as layers. As such:

 - I didn't have access to the correct font, so I have improvised with the closest match I could find.
 - I didn't have the individual images, so have had to crop them out, hence backgrounds and unoptimised file sizes.
 - I couldn't make accurate measurements between elements, so have done it 'by eye'.

I wasn't sure whether frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, jQuery, etc... were allowed, so it's vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.
